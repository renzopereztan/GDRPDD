# GDRPDD

This is a program that solves the generalized directed rural postman problem formulated on the context of a metro network. 

It accepts an edge list with weight and line information as input and finds the minimum (and maximum) weighted paths in the network that uses each line at least once.

The TdZdd library is needed for the the program to work.
